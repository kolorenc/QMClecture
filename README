ABOUT

  Basic VMC and DMC code meant for educational and demonstration purposes.
  See doc/man.pdf for more details.

COMPILATION

  Create 'make/default.mk' with appropriate compiler definitions. There are
  several examples in the 'make' directory. Afterwards, executing 'make'
  should build the software. Alternatively, one can skip the make/default.mk
  and execute 'make PLATFORM=gnu', for instance, which would take compiler
  definitions from 'make/gnu.mk'.
